Learn to detect motion and perform text recognition.
 
In Object Detection: Part 1, we explored some methods of detecting specific objects like Template matching and Cascade Object Detector. These methods are known has Binary Classifiers since they tell us if a specific object is present or not. If an object is found they give us the location of the object.

In Part 2, we will go over motion detection and text recognition. Motion detection will be performed with Optical Flow and text recognition will be performed using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
